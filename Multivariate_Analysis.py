Questions: Create goals that investigate potential relationships between the variabels in the dataset , When creating the goals consider description , sample elements and type of measurement , Generate only  MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS goals , For now DON'T CREATE GOALS which Involves Time(year,month,date) , ALWAYS allocate a goal for creating a correlation matrix between numerical variabels
Suggested Visualizations: Suggest a single and most effective visualization for answer the question , Consider the type of measurement and description for suggesting the visualization ,follow these rules if the type of measurement is :\ni)continuous vs continuous use scatter plot\nii)discrete vs discrete use Grouped Bar plot\niii)discrete vs continuous use box plot or violin plot\niv)categorical vs categorical use Contingency Plot(Cross Tab)\nv)discrete vs categorical use bar chart\n
Rationale: Provide a rationale for the insights you expect to uncover through these questions and visualizations. Explain why these questions and visualizations are important for understanding the relationships between variables in the dataset. What key interactions or patterns do you hope to reveal using these techniques?
Specify the variable used
Can come up with 5 goals
Rules:
1) The VISUALIZATIONS YOU RECOMMEND MUST FOLLOW VISUALIZATION BEST PRACTICES (e.g., must use bar charts instead of pie charts for comparing quantities)
2) Striclty no univariate anlysis
